## 〢 Introduction

An Unofficial ReShade For All HoYoVerse Games on PC.

The working principle of Reshade is to intercept communication between the CPU and GPU and modify image information to improve image quality. This repository's ReShade integrates some open-source projects based on the official ReShade (for the specific list please check the [Sources Page](#〢-Sources)), making it compatible with all HoYoVerse games on PC and creating some targeted presets. In the future, it will support more HoYoVerse games.

Please refer to the [Contributors Page](#〢-Contributors) for information about contributors to this repository.

## 〢 Pre-Warning

> [!Warning]
> ·The Genshin Impact/Yuanshen game in mainland China has strengthened its identification of mods and cheats by connecting to Tencent's anti-cheating system. This means that any mods or cheats are more likely to be identified by HoYoVerse, and consequently, your account is more likely to be banned or face other serious consequences. No mod or cheat can guarantee the absolute safety of your game account. Although HoYoShade can run on the official servers of HoYoVerse games,it does not guarantee the absolute safety of your game account.If you are worried that your game account will be banned, please consider setting up a private server.  
> ·Before sharing game content with anyone else or streaming, HoYoShade recommends using other mods to hide your game UID and user information, and not to display HoYoShade or other mod interfaces to anyone else.

> [!NOTE]
> · In addition, HoYoShade recommends updating your graphics card and chipset drivers to the latest version (if available) to minimize graphics-related issues prevent game crashes, and receive the latest support from your device manufacturer.  
> · We do not recommend running HoYoShade on official servers.  
> · We do not recommend using the Beta client to run HoYoShade on official servers to avoid the risk of confidentiality agreement breaches/violations/illegal activities/economic losses for all HoYoShade developers/secondary developers and yourself.  
> ·Contributors to the HoYoShade repository and all contributors who have developed based on HoYoShade will not be responsible for any consequences that may occur when running HoYoShade on the official servers of HoYoVerse games.  

## 〢 Support games list
  
REL(Releases) Client：  
  
> [!NOTE]
> ·For private server players, if the corresponding client required by the private server appears in the supported games list below, then HoYoShade can provide support.

> ·For games that do not appear in the supported games list, you can try to select a game that is already supported in the injector or choose custom injection in the developer options to try injecting HoYoShade.

CB/CBT(Close Beta Test)Client:    
  
> [!NOTE]
> ·For private server players, if the corresponding client required by the private server appears in the supported games list below, then HoYoShade can provide support.    
> ·MiHoYo/HoYoVerse's beta clients released to testers after the official release usually have client version numbers like: X.5.X, X.X.Y (where X is the current REL (Release) version number), X.X.Y0 (where X is the current REL (Releases) version number), etc. And they usually have different file encryption/launchers compared to REL (Release) clients. Please verify the version and source of the client you have.  
> ·HoYoShade理論上也可以對Beta版(測試服)客戶端提供注入和運行支持，但我們對任何測試服客戶端的注入和運行支持不作成功性/功能性保證。  
> ·We do not recommend that you use the beta client to run HoYoShade on official servers, to avoid the risk of violating confidentiality agreements/regulations/laws/economic losses for all HoYoShade developers/secondary developers and yourself.  
> ·Unless the option in the table below is "Yes," this indicates that HoYoShade has only been tested on some leaked clients of this type and has concluded that it is supported. This does not mean that all versions/types/sources of different game internal test clients can run HoYoShade. Please test it yourself.   
> ·If the test server client you are using does not support running HoYoShade, and you are very sure that this is not caused by using the wrong injection option, please create a new issue on the [issues pages](https://github.com/DuolaD/HoYoShade/issues) to help us adapt. Or use the developer function of the launcher to try custom injection.  
> ·For games that do not appear in the supported games list, you can try to select a game that is already supported in the injector or choose custom injection in the developer options to try injecting HoYoShade.

> [!NOTE]
> ·For the Private Server player, If the corresponding client required by the private server appears in the list of supported games, that means HoYoShade can support it.  
> ·For the Beta client of MiHoYo/HoYoVerse developers aimed at testers after the public test (usually the client version number is: current version number.5.X), HoYoShade can theoretically provide injection and operation support. However, we do not recommend using the Beta client to run HoYoShade on official servers to avoid the risk of confidentiality agreement breaches/violations/illegal activities/economic losses for all HoYoShade developers/secondary developers and yourself.  
> ·For Beta version clients released to testers by MiHoYo/HoYoVerse after the official release (usually with a client version number of: current version number.5.X), HoYoShade only tests and supports leaked clients, which does not imply that all versions of beta clients can run HoYoShade. If the test server client you are using does not support running HoYoShade, and you are certain that this is not due to using the wrong injection option, please create a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/DuolaD/HoYoShade/issues) to help us with adaptation. Alternatively, you can use the launcher's developer features to try custom injection.  
> ·For games that don't appear in the list of supported games, you can try to inject HoYoShade by choosing to use a game already supported in the injector or selecting Custom Inject in the developer options.    
> ·HoYoShade supports simultaneous injection with other mainstream mods without any conflict issues. However, please note and ensure that there are no conflicts between other game mods.

## 〢 OpenHoYoShade and HoYoShade

Since we publish V2.012.2 Stable,we start publish OpenHoYoShade with HoYoShade.  

OpenHoYoShade is the underlying basic framework of HoYoShade, which covers all the necessary files to inject ReShade into all miHoYo/HoYoverse games.  
OpenHoYoShade storage footprint is smaller than HoYoShade,  
However, OpenHoYoShade does not have a built-in ReShade effect library, presets, etc., which is suitable for secondary developers who want to redevelop HoYoShade. 

If you just want to use reshade in the MiHoYo/HoYoVerse games, download HoYoShade.  
If you want to develop your own reshade and hope it can work in the MiHoYo/HoYoVerse games, but you don't want to learn some peace of shit——  
then,check OpenHoYoShade.  

The only thing you need to do to make OpenHoYoShade work quickly is to put the effect library and presets in their respective places.  
But if you want, you can develop more, such as injector,Reshade.ini Builder, etc. even Redistribution!(Long live open source!)  
(By the way......make sure you comply with BSD-3 license when you Redistribution)

also,If you want to get the old version of the injector/more information, click on the 'Code' button in the GitHub repository and select 'Download Zip'.  

If you still can't understand what are the different between OpenHoYoShade and HoYoShade,then check the graph:  

|  | OpenHoYoShade | HoYoShade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ReShade** | Yes | Yes |
| **All the necessary files to inject ReShade into all miHoYo/HoYoverse games** | Yes | Yes |
| **Program source code** | Yes | No |
| **Reshade effect library(Contains Addons)** | No(Need to prepare yourself) | Yes |
| **Presets** | No(Need to prepare yourself) | Yes |
| **Who needs them?** | Secondary developer | Gamer |

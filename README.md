## Intro
An unofficial Reshade, suitable for Yuanshin and Bengtie: Interstellar Railway (other HoyoVerse games have not been tested)  
Since HoyoVerse blocked the official Reshade after Genshin impact version 1.1 install in the game root and refuse to load it  
Therefore, an injected Reshade is needed to break through the blockade of HoyoVerse and run

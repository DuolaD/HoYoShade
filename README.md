## Introduction  
This is an unofficial Reshade that allows it to be used in Genshin Impact and Honkai:Star Rail (other HoyoVerse games have not been tested)  
HoyoVerse has blocked the official Reshade since the Genshin Impact version 1.1.  
If you install the official Reshade in the game directory and try to launch the game after version 1.1, the game will refuse to load Reshade.  
Therefore, an injectable Reshade is needed to bypass HoyoVerse's block and run Reshade.  

## About the original author

Based on this file, I made some modifications to Reshade. However, the original author of Reshade Unofficial did not leave their name in the file.  
If you know who the original author is, or if you are the original author, please contact me.

## Note
I do not recommend running this mod on HoyoVerse's official servers, even though it can run on them.  
In fact, no matter which mod you install, it is possible to be detected and have your account banned by HoyoVerse.  
If you are really afraid of being banned by HoyoVerse, please set up a private server on your own.  
If you choose to run this mod on the official server, you are responsible for the consequences of your actions. I will not be responsible for any losses caused by account bans.

### About Genshin Impact in Mainland China  
By the way, the Mainland China version of Genshin Impact has integrated Tencent's anti-cheat system since version 2.8.  
This means that all mods are more likely to be detected by HoyoVerse.  
As I mentioned before, you are responsible for the consequences of your actions. I will not be responsible for any losses caused by account bans.

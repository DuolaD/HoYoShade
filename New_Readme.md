## 〢 Introduction

A Unofficial ReShade For All HoYoVerse Games on PC.

The working principle of Reshade is to intercept communication between the CPU and GPU and modify image information to improve image quality. This repository's ReShade integrates some open-source projects based on the official ReShade (for the specific list please check the [Sources Page](#〢-Sources)), making it compatible with all HoYoVerse games on PC and creating some targeted presets. In the future, it will support more HoYoVerse games.

Please refer to the [Contributors Page]() for information about contributors to this repository.

## 〢 Information

The Genshin Impact server in mainland China has integrated Tencent's anti-cheat system and strengthened mod recognition. This means that any mods or cheats are more likely to be detected by HoYoVerse, 
which also increases the possibility of your account being banned or facing other serious consequences. 

No mods or cheats can guarantee the absolute safety of your game account.
While HoYoShade can run on the official HoYoVerse server, 
it does not guarantee the absolute safety of your game account. 
Therefore, if you are concerned about any consequences on your game account on the official server, 
create a private server to ensure the absolute safety of your game account on the HoYoVerse official server.
If you run HoYoShade on the official HoYoVerse server, the contributors to the HoYoShade repository and all contributors to any secondary development based on HoYoShade will not be held responsible for any consequences. 

Before sharing game content with anyone else or broadcasting,
HoYoShade suggests using other Mods to hide the game UID and user information,
and not to show the HoYoShade and other mod interfaces to anyone else.

In addition, HoYoShade recommends updating your graphics card and chipset drivers to the latest version (if available) to receive the latest support from your device manufacturer to minimize graphics-related issues and prevent game crashes.
